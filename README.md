# ⚙ Novus Reforged

### ❓ What is Novus Reforged?
[Novus Reforged](https://curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/novus-reforged) is an updated version of [Novus Remix](https://www.technicpack.net/modpack/novus-bevo) by [ZeranaxTV](https://www.technicpack.net/profile/2952282). Novus Remix itself is a newer edition of [Novus Youtube](https://www.technicpack.net/modpack/novus-youtube-edition) (not an official upload as the original was taken offline), which was used in the German YouTube project Novus (click [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9oBXB6tQnlUXEqntClezLT_U5vrXYILy) for skate702's videos). Novus Youtube is originally built upon the foundation of [Bevos Tech Pack](https://atlauncher.com/pack/bevostechpack).

### 🤔 Why does Novus Reforged exist?
Novus Remix hasn't received updates for over six years. During this time, various vulnerabilities have been identified and remain open to potential exploitation. Additionally, numerous mods have been launched that could significantly improve the gameplay, like the GNTH mod forks, for instance.

Novus Reforged seeks to bring back the classic Novus vibe while adding a modern flair to it.

### 🔃 What changed?
Several mods have been updated or replaced, while certain mods were removed due to issues such as broken functionality or overly restrictive licenses. Additionally, certain mods have been introduced to provide extra content, address bugs, or fix exploits.

We've reintroduced the quest line from the original Bevos Tech Pack and made some improvements to it. Now, there's a clear guide to help players progress through the pack.
